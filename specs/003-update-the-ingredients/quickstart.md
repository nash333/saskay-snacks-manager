## Success Criteria Summary

âœ… **Phase 1 Complete** when all scenarios pass:
- [ ] Metaobject definitions created successfully
- [ ] Categories created and validated (uniqueness enforced)
- [ ] Unit types created with proper type categories
- [ ] Ingredients CRUD operations work correctly
- [ ] Search and filtering work as expected
- [ ] Recipes created with ingredient relationships
- [ ] Bidirectional relationships maintained
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Deletion blocked when dependencies exist
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Referential integrity enforced for categories, unit types, recipes
- [ ] Soft delete works correctly
- [ ] Pagination handles > 20 ingredients
- [ ] Error messages are clear and actionable

## Next Steps After Validation

1. Run automated integration tests (`npm test`)
2. Check test coverage (`npm run test:coverage`)
3. Review performance with 500+ ingredients
4. Verify Shopify API rate limit handling
5. Test in production-like environment (staging store)

## Rollback Plan (If Issues Found)

1. **Critical Bugs**: Revert to previous branch
2. **Data Corruption**: Use Shopify Admin to manually delete metaobjects
3. **API Errors**: Check Shopify API status and rate limits
4. **Performance Issues**: Implement caching and query optimization

## Notes

- All tests should be performed in a development store
- Document any deviations from expected results
- Take screenshots of error states for debugging
- Monitor browser console for GraphQL errors
- Check Shopify Admin â†’ Settings â†’ Apps â†’ App logs for server-side errors
