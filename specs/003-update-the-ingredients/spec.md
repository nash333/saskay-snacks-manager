## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-30
- Q: What core fields does an Ingredient entity require beyond name, category, and unit type? ‚Üí A: Name, category, unit type, quantity on hand, cost per unit, SKU, supplier name, description, notes
- Q: How should the system handle ingredient-recipe relationships? ‚Üí A: Many-to-many bidirectional (recipes specify ingredients with quantities; ingredients show which recipes use them)
- Q: What deletion behavior should the system use for ingredients linked to recipes? ‚Üí A: Block deletion entirely (show error message listing affected recipes, prevent delete)
- Q: Are metaobjects (categories, unit types, recipes) Shopify-native metaobjects or custom data structures? ‚Üí A: Shopify-native metaobjects (using Shopify's Metaobject API)
- Q: Should metaobjects (categories/unit types) in use by ingredients be deletable? ‚Üí A: Block deletion entirely (prevent delete, show error listing affected ingredients)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A merchant managing MM Stationery Shoppers needs to maintain a comprehensive inventory of ingredients used in their products. They need to configure ingredient categories (e.g., Paper, Adhesives, Plastics) and unit types (e.g., grams, milliliters, pieces) through a configuration page, then create, view, update, and delete individual ingredients with proper categorization. Ingredients should be linkable to recipes [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: are recipes for manufactured products or something else?], enabling proper tracking of component materials.

### Acceptance Scenarios

**Configuration Management**
1. **Given** a merchant is on the configuration page, **When** they create a new ingredient category (e.g., "Binding Materials"), **Then** the category becomes available for ingredient assignment
2. **Given** a merchant is on the configuration page, **When** they create a new unit type (e.g., "meters"), **Then** the unit type becomes available for ingredient measurement
3. **Given** metaobjects are configured, **When** a merchant navigates to the ingredients page, **Then** the metaobject options are available in dropdown/selection fields

**Ingredient CRUD Operations**
4. **Given** a merchant is on the ingredients page, **When** they click "Add Ingredient", **Then** they can enter ingredient details (name, category, unit type, quantity on hand, cost per unit, SKU, supplier name, description, notes) and save
5. **Given** ingredients exist in the system, **When** a merchant views the ingredients page, **Then** all ingredients are displayed with their name, category, unit type, quantity on hand, cost per unit, and SKU
6. **Given** a merchant views an ingredient, **When** they click "Edit", **Then** they can modify ingredient details and save changes
7. **Given** a merchant views an ingredient not linked to recipes, **When** they click "Delete" and confirm, **Then** the ingredient is permanently removed from the system
8. **Given** an ingredient is linked to recipes, **When** a merchant attempts to delete it, **Then** deletion is blocked and an error message displays listing all affected recipes with navigation links

**Recipe Integration**
9. **Given** recipes are configured, **When** a merchant creates or edits a recipe, **Then** they can specify which ingredients are needed with quantity per ingredient
10. **Given** an ingredient is used in recipes, **When** viewing the ingredient detail page, **Then** all recipes using that ingredient are displayed with links to recipe details

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a merchant tries to delete a category that has ingredients assigned to it?
- What happens when a merchant tries to delete a unit type that is in use?
- How does the system handle duplicate ingredient names?
- What happens if a merchant creates an ingredient without selecting a category or unit type?
- How does the system handle bulk import/export of ingredients?
- What happens when metaobjects are modified after ingredients have been created using them?
- How does the system validate ingredient quantities and measurements?
- What happens when a recipe references an ingredient that no longer exists?

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Ingredient**: Represents a raw material or component used in products. Includes name (text, required, unique), assigned category (reference, required), assigned unit type (reference, required), quantity on hand (numeric), cost per unit (currency), SKU (alphanumeric), supplier name (text), description (text), notes (text area), and relationships to recipes. Must be uniquely identifiable and properly categorized.

- **Ingredient Category**: Represents a classification grouping for ingredients (e.g., Paper, Adhesives, Binding Materials). Created via configuration page as a metaobject. Includes category name and [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: description? display order? icon/color?]. Used to organize and filter ingredients.

- **Unit Type**: Represents the measurement unit for ingredient quantities (e.g., grams, kilograms, milliliters, liters, pieces, sheets). Created via configuration page as a metaobject. Includes unit name, [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: abbreviation? conversion factors? unit system (metric/imperial)?]. Ensures consistent measurement across ingredients.

- **Recipe**: Represents a formula or bill of materials that combines multiple ingredients to create products. Created via configuration page as a metaobject. Includes recipe name and many-to-many relationships to ingredients with quantity specification per ingredient. Flat structure only (no nested recipes).

- **Metaobject Configuration**: Represents Shopify-native metaobject definitions for ingredient-related data structures (categories, unit types, recipes). Managed via Shopify's Metaobject API. Includes metaobject type definitions and field schemas that enable structured data storage within Shopify's system.

### Open Questions Requiring Clarification
1. **Current State**: What is the existing state of the ingredients page - does it exist? What functionality is currently present?
2. **Ingredient Data Model**: What fields/attributes does an ingredient have beyond name, category, and unit type (e.g., cost, quantity, supplier, SKU, description)?
3. **Recipe Purpose**: What are recipes used for - manufacturing, bundling, cost calculation, inventory management?
4. **Recipe-Ingredient Relationship**: How do recipes and ingredients relate - one-to-many, many-to-many? Do recipes specify quantities per ingredient?
5. **Metaobject Type**: Are metaobjects Shopify-native metaobjects or a custom data structure within the app?
6. **Deletion Behavior**: Should ingredient deletion be hard delete (permanent) or soft delete (mark inactive)? What happens to linked recipes?
7. **Dependency Constraints**: Can categories/unit types be deleted if in use? How are dependencies managed?
8. **Validation Rules**: What specific validation rules apply to ingredient data (uniqueness, format, ranges)?
9. **Display Fields**: What information should be shown in the ingredient list view versus detail view?
10. **Search & Filter**: What filtering, sorting, and search capabilities are needed for ingredients?
11. **Bulk Operations**: Is bulk import/export of ingredients required?
12. **Audit Trail**: Should the system maintain version history or audit trail for ingredient changes?
13. **Nested Recipes**: Do recipes support nested structures (recipes containing other recipes) or only flat ingredient lists?
14. **Auto-save**: Should forms auto-save drafts or require explicit save actions?
15. **Accessibility**: What accessibility features are required (keyboard navigation, screen reader support)?
