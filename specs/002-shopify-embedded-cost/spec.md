## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A merchant managing MM Stationery Shoppers needs to configure different cost calculations for products based on tax requirements, regional pricing differences, and bulk purchase incentives. Once configured, these calculations should be automatically applied and displayed [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: to whom - merchants only, or customers viewing products?] in the product interface, ensuring accurate pricing across different markets and purchase quantities.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a merchant is logged into the Shopify admin, **When** they navigate to cost calculation settings, **Then** they can configure tax rates for different product categories or regions
2. **Given** a merchant has configured regional markups (e.g., Gauteng 10%, Eastern Cape 15%), **When** products are viewed [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: by whom and where?], **Then** the appropriate regional markup is applied to the base cost
3. **Given** a merchant has set bulk discount rules (e.g., 10+ items = 5% off, 50+ items = 15% off), **When** [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: who views?] products in eligible quantities, **Then** the discounted cost is calculated and displayed
4. **Given** multiple cost factors are configured (tax + regional markup + bulk discount), **When** a product cost is calculated, **Then** all applicable factors are combined correctly
5. **Given** cost calculation settings have been saved, **When** a merchant views a product, **Then** the calculated cost is displayed alongside [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: base price? original cost? margin information?]

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a product belongs to multiple regions or has conflicting regional markups?
- How does the system handle tax rates that change over time - are they versioned or retroactive?
- What happens if bulk discount thresholds overlap or conflict?
- How are costs calculated for bundle products versus individual items?
- What happens when regional markups are configured but the location-based filtering system (from Feature 001) hasn't identified a region?
- How does the system handle negative margins (when combined discounts exceed base cost)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**Configuration Management**
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow merchants to configure tax rates [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: per product category? per region? globally?]
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow merchants to configure regional markup percentages for each location [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: are these the same locations as the filtering system from Feature 001?]
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow merchants to configure bulk discount rules with quantity thresholds and discount percentages
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate that tax rates are between 0% and [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum tax rate percentage?]
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate that regional markups are [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: positive only? can be negative for discounts? what range?]
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate that bulk discount quantities are positive integers and discounts don't exceed 100%
- **FR-007**: System MUST persist all cost calculation configuration settings [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: per product? globally? per category?]
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow merchants to edit or delete existing cost calculation rules

**Cost Calculation**
- **FR-009**: System MUST calculate product costs by applying configured tax rates to base costs
- **FR-010**: System MUST calculate product costs by applying regional markups based on [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: user location? merchant selection? product assignment?]
- **FR-011**: System MUST calculate product costs by applying bulk discounts when quantity thresholds are met [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: at what point in the purchase flow?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST apply cost factors in a defined order [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what order? tax then markup then discount? or different?]
- **FR-013**: System MUST recalculate costs when any configuration setting changes [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: in real-time? on save? on page refresh?]
- **FR-014**: System MUST handle cases where multiple bulk discount tiers apply by [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: using highest discount? most specific? first match?]

**Display and Interface**
- **FR-015**: System MUST display calculated costs in the product interface [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which interface - admin, storefront, both?]
- **FR-016**: System MUST display [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what cost breakdown? just final price? show components?] alongside products
- **FR-017**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: update displayed costs dynamically as quantity changes? require page refresh?]
- **FR-018**: System MUST display [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: cost calculation methodology? just final number? savings amount?] to [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: merchants? customers? both?]
- **FR-019**: System MUST provide visual indication when bulk discounts are active or thresholds are approaching

**Integration**
- **FR-020**: System MUST integrate with existing Shopify product data structures [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: how does this relate to product metafields? variants? base pricing?]
- **FR-021**: System MUST integrate with the location-based filtering system from Feature 001 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: are regional markups automatically tied to location filters?]
- **FR-022**: System MUST work with both individual products and bundles [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: how are bundle costs calculated - sum of items? separate rules?]

**Business Rules**
- **FR-023**: System MUST prevent cost calculations that result in negative final prices
- **FR-024**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: rounding rules for calculated costs - round up? down? to nearest cent?]
- **FR-025**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: log cost calculation history? audit trail? or just show current values?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Cost Calculation Configuration**: Represents the settings for how costs are calculated, including relationships to tax rates, regional markups, and bulk discount rules. May be scoped at [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: product level? category level? global level?]

- **Tax Rate**: Represents a percentage applied to product costs, potentially varying by [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: product category? region? both?]. Includes the rate percentage and scope of application.

- **Regional Markup**: Represents a percentage markup applied based on geographic location. Includes the markup percentage and associated location/region identifier [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: same regions as Feature 001 location filtering?].

- **Bulk Discount Rule**: Represents quantity-based discounts with threshold quantities and discount percentages. Includes minimum quantity threshold and discount amount [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: flat amount or percentage?].

- **Calculated Cost**: Represents the final computed cost for a product after applying all relevant factors. Includes [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: breakdown of components? just final number? original cost for comparison?].

## Dependencies & Assumptions

### Dependencies
- Feature 001: Location-based filtering system (regional markups may need to align with location data)
- Shopify product data structure and pricing model
- Existing Shopify admin interface for configuration screens

### Assumptions
- Merchants have permission to configure pricing and cost settings
- Base product costs are already available in the system
- The system supports percentage-based calculations
- Currency and locale handling is already established

### Open Questions Requiring Clarification
1. **Visibility**: Are calculated costs visible to customers, merchants only, or both?
2. **Scope**: Are cost settings global, per-category, or per-product?
3. **Integration**: How do regional markups map to the location filtering from Feature 001?
4. **Calculation Order**: In what sequence are tax, markup, and discounts applied?
5. **Real-time Updates**: Do costs recalculate dynamically or require refresh/save actions?
6. **Display Format**: What cost information is shown (final price only, breakdown, savings)?
7. **Bundle Handling**: How are costs calculated for pre-built bundles versus individual items?
8. **Conflict Resolution**: How are overlapping rules (multiple regions, discount tiers) resolved?
9. **Historical Data**: Is there a need for cost calculation audit trails or version history?
10. **Rounding Rules**: What are the rounding conventions for calculated costs?
