   - `SHOPIFY_API_KEY` (from Partner Dashboard)
   - `SHOPIFY_API_SECRET` (from Partner Dashboard) 
   - `SCOPES` (Shopify app permissions)
   - `HOST` (production domain)
   - `SHOPIFY_APP_URL` (production app URL)

2. **Database Migration**:
   - Run `npx prisma migrate deploy` in production
   - Verify PostgreSQL connection and permissions
   - Confirm session table creation

3. **Security Configuration**:
   - Verify HTTPS enforcement
   - Configure proper CORS settings
   - Set up secure session storage
   - Validate webhook signatures
