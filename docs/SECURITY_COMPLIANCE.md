## 1. Data Protection and Privacy

### 1.1 Shop-Level Data Isolation (FR-017)

**Requirement**: All customer data must be completely isolated by shop, with no possibility of cross-shop data access.

**Implementation**:
- **Service-Level Scoping**: All data operations include mandatory shop identification
- **Authentication Validation**: Every request validates shop-specific credentials
- **Database Scoping**: All queries automatically filter by authenticated shop context
- **Access Control**: Security guards prevent unauthorized cross-shop access attempts

**Technical Controls**:
```typescript
// Shop scope validation in all operations
class MetaobjectsService {
  constructor(graphqlClient: any, shopId: string) {
    this.graphql = graphqlClient;
    this.shopId = shopId; // Mandatory shop scoping
  }

  private validateShopScope(targetShopId: string): void {
    if (this.shopId !== targetShopId) {
      throw new SecurityError('Cross-shop access denied');
    }
  }
}
```

**Verification**:
- ✅ 11 automated tests validating shop isolation
- ✅ Multi-shop environment testing
- ✅ Cross-shop access prevention verified
- ✅ Session token validation implemented

### 1.2 Data Classification

| Data Type | Classification | Protection Level | Retention |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|-----------|
| Ingredient Data | Confidential | Shop-scoped encryption | 7 years |
| Price Information | Confidential | Shop-scoped encryption | 7 years |
| Recipe Data | Confidential | Shop-scoped encryption | 7 years |
| Audit Logs | Restricted | Encrypted + immutable | 10 years |
| Session Tokens | Restricted | Encrypted + short TTL | 24 hours |

### 1.3 Personal Data Protection (GDPR Compliance)
